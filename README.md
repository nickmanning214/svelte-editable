# Purpose

This package is a toolbox for dealing with a component that can be editable. An editable component is always one of five states:

1. Read only state
2. Admin state (You have permission to enter edit mode)
3. Editing state (You can edit but you have not changed anything)
4. Dirty state (You have edited and now the component is savable)
5. Saving state (You are currently saving)
